2014-01-06    mlpack 1.0.8

  * Memory leak in NeighborSearch index-mapping code fixed (#310).

  * GMMs can be trained using the existing model as a starting point by
    specifying an additional boolean parameter to GMM::Estimate() (#308).

  * Logistic regression implementation added in methods/logistic_regression (see
    also #305).

  * L-BFGS optimizer now returns its function via Function().

  * Version information is now obtainable via mlpack::util::GetVersion() or the
    __MLPACK_VERSION_MAJOR, __MLPACK_VERSION_MINOR, and  __MLPACK_VERSION_PATCH
    macros (#309).

  * Fix typos in allkfn and allkrann output.

2013-10-04    mlpack 1.0.7

  * Cover tree support for range search (range_search), rank-approximate nearest
    neighbors (allkrann), minimum spanning tree calculation (emst), and FastMKS
    (fastmks).

  * Dual-tree FastMKS implementation added and tested.

  * Added collaborative filtering package (cf) that can provide recommendations
    when given users and items.

  * Fix for correctness of Kernel PCA (kernel_pca) (#280).

  * Speedups for PCA and Kernel PCA (#204).

  * Fix for correctness of Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) (#289).

  * Minor speedups for dual-tree algorithms.

  * Fix for Naive Bayes Classifier (nbc) (#279).

  * Added a ridge regression option to LinearRegression (linear_regression)
    (#298).

  * Gaussian Mixture Models (gmm::GMM<>) now support arbitrary covariance matrix
    constraints (#294).

  * MVU (mvu) removed because it is known to not work (#189).

  * Minor updates and fixes for kernels (in mlpack::kernel).

2013-06-13    mlpack 1.0.6

  * Minor bugfix so that FastMKS gets built.

2013-05-01    mlpack 1.0.5

  * Speedups of cover tree traversers (#243).

  * Addition of rank-approximate nearest neighbors (RANN), found in
    src/mlpack/methods/rann/.

  * Addition of fast exact max-kernel search (FastMKS), found in
    src/mlpack/methods/fastmks/.

  * Fix for EM covariance estimation; this should improve GMM training time.

  * More parameters for GMM estimation.

  * Force GMM and GaussianDistribution covariance matrices to be positive
    definite, so that training converges much more often.

  * Add parameter for the tolerance of the Baum-Welch algorithm for HMM
    training.

  * Fix for compilation with clang compiler.

  * Fix for k-furthest-neighbor-search.

2013-02-08    mlpack 1.0.4

  * Force minimum Armadillo version to 2.4.2.

  * Better output of class types to streams; a class with a ToString() method
    implemented can be sent to a stream with operator<<.  See #164.

  * Change return type of GMM::Estimate() to double (#266).

  * Style fixes for k-means and RADICAL.

  * Handle size_t support correctly with Armadillo 3.6.2 (#267).

  * Add locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), found in src/mlpack/methods/lsh/.

  * Better tests for SGD (stochastic gradient descent) and NCA (neighborhood
    components analysis).

2012-09-16    mlpack 1.0.3

  * Remove internal sparse matrix support because Armadillo 3.4.0 now includes
    it.  When using Armadillo versions older than 3.4.0, sparse matrix support
    is not available.

  * NCA (neighborhood components analysis) now support an arbitrary optimizer
    (#254), including stochastic gradient descent (#258).

2012-08-15    mlpack 1.0.2

  * Added density estimation trees, found in src/mlpack/methods/det/.

  * Added non-negative matrix factorization, found in src/mlpack/methods/nmf/.

  * Added experimental cover tree implementation, found in
    src/mlpack/core/tree/cover_tree/ (#156).

  * Better reporting of boost::program_options errors (#231).

  * Fix for timers on Windows (#218, #217).

  * Fix for allknn and allkfn output (#210).

  * Sparse coding dictionary initialization is now a template parameter (#226).

2012-03-03    mlpack 1.0.1

  * Added kernel principal components analysis (kernel PCA), found in
    src/mlpack/methods/kernel_pca/ (#47).

  * Fix for Lovasz-Theta AugLagrangian tests (#188).

  * Fixes for allknn output (#191, #192).

  * Added range search executable (#198).

  * Adapted citations in documentation to BiBTeX; no citations in -h output
    (#201).

  * Stop use of 'const char*' and prefer 'std::string' (#183).

  * Support seeds for random numbers (#182).
