 * Tests for the TreeTraits class.  These could all be known at compile-time,
 * but realistically the function is to be sure that nobody changes tree traits
 * without breaking something.  Thus, people must be certain when they make a
 * change like that (because they have to change the test too).  That's the
 * hope, at least...
